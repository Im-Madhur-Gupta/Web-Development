- Browser only understands JS, TS has to be compiled to JS.

- Js mai sare nums float ke form mai hote he to 5 is equal to 5.0.

- Some special JS operators - 
1. Nullish Coalescing operator (??)
-> x??y
-> if x is null OR undefined then return y otherwise return the value of x.

2. Optional Chaining operator (?.)
-> x?.y
-> if x is null or undefined then return undefined otherwise return the value of ppt y of x.

- any type in TS yani kuch bhi daldo.

- IMP - 
    - Void represents the return value of functions which don’t return a value. 
    - It’s the inferred type any time a function doesn’t have any return statements, or doesn’t return any explicit value from those return statements.
    - void vs undefined -
        - In JavaScript, a function that doesn’t return any value will implicitly return the value undefined.
        - In TypeScript, void is not the same as undefined.
        - VV IMP -> void in TS means return value won't be observed, can return any value, but it will be ignored.

- Interface vs Type -
    - General use case mai koi pharak ni padta.
    - key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.
