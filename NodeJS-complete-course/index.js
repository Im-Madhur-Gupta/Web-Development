// As JavaScript is universal we need to know where our code would be executing, is it in the browser or just in the backend.
// Here, its just in the backend ie Nodejs, so things like alert, any visual popup that was supported natively by a browser is of no use in the backend, ie are NOT supported by Nodejs.

// alert("hi"); --> No use in backend
